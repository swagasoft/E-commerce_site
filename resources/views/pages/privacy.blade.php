                    <p>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information
                            We provide such information to our trusted businesses or persons for

                            to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
                             effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests 
                        concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise. </p></div>
